# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For this project I will create a web app that allows a user to create a profile, and be prompted to answer several questions related to their mental health/mood each day. The questions the user answers will be the same each day, some yes/no questions, while others will allow for more open-ended, diary style answers. There will also be a component where a person (doctor/health provider/designated family member) will have access to these answers and can leave comments on the user's answers. 
### Features
Users can create and authenticate accounts
Users can create posts in the form of answers to prompts/questions
Notification system for doctor/health provider for when their patient submits an update

### Technologies
Java
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn how to set up the notification system for other users when a response to a prompt/question is submitted
I'll also need to learn how to enable comments on posts
